0. Install new 3... Python (I've tested 3.8.6)

1. Update submodules

git submodule update

2. pip install conan

make sure conan is visible from the command line, i.e. path to python scripts is there
pip will warn you during install and give the correct path

IF U NEED VULKAN

3. cd modules\dasVulkan			
conan install .

4. download and install https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#sdk/downloadConfirm/1.2.162.0/windows/VulkanSDK-1.2.162.0-Installer.exe
later ones may work too?
