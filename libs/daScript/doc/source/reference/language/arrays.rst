    single: Arrays

An array is a sequence of values indexed by a integer number from 0 to the size of the
array minus 1. Arrays elements can be obtained through their index.
::

  var a = [[int[4] 1; 2; 3; 4]] // fixed size of array is 4, and content is [1, 2, 3, 4]
  assert(a[0] == 1)

  var b: array<int>
  push(b,1)
  assert(b[0] == 1)

There are static arrays (of fixed size, allocated on stack), and dynamic array (size is dynamic, allocated on heap) ::

  var a = [[int[4] 1; 2; 3; 4]] // fixed size of array is 4, and content is [1, 2, 3, 4]
  var b: array<string>          // empty dynamic array
  push(b, "some")               // now it is 1 element of "some"
  b |> push("some")             // same as above line, but using pipe operator

Resizing, insertion, deletion of dynamic arrays and arrays elements is done through a set of
standard functions (see :ref:`built-in functions <stdlib__builtin>`).

List of relevant builtin functions: push, push_clone, emplace, reserve, resize, erase, length, clear, capacity.

Arrays (as well as tables, structures, and handled types) will be passed to functions by reference only.

Arrays can not be copied, only cloned or moved. ::

  def clone_array(var a, b: array<string>)
    a := b      // a is not a deep copy of b
    clone(a, b) // same as above

  def move_array(var a, b: array<string>)
    a <- b  // a is no points to same data as b, and b is empty.

Arrays can be constructed inline ::

	let arr = [[auto 1.; 2.; 3.; 4.5]]

Which infers to ::

	let arr : float[4] = [[float[4] 1.; 2.; 3.; 4.5]]

Dynamic arrays can also be constructed inline::

	let arr <- [{auto "one"; "two"; "three"}]

Which is syntactic equivalent to::

	let arr : array<string> <- to_array_move([[string[4] "one"; "two"; "three"]])

If only one element is specified, local data construction is that element::

	let i1 = [[int 1]]	// same is the line bellow
	let i2 = 1

To create an array of unspecified type, use [] syntax::

	let ai1 <- [[int[] 1]]	// actually [[int[1] 1]]
	let ai2 <- [[auto[] 1]	// same as above

When array elements can't be copied, use push_clone to insert clone of a value, or emplace to move it in.

resize can potentially create new array elements. Those elements will be initialized with 0.

reserve is there for performance reasons. Generally array capacity doubles, if exceeded.
Reserve allows to specify exact known capacity, and significantly reduce the overhead of multiple push operations.

Its possible to iterate over an array via regular for loop::

	for x in [[int[] 1;2;3;4]]
		print("x = {x}\n")

Additionally a collection of unsafe iterators is provided::

  def each ( a : auto(TT)[] ) : iterator<TT&>
  def each ( a : array<auto(TT)> ) : iterator<TT&>

The reason both are unsafe operation is that they do not capture an array.

Search functions are available for both static and dynamic arrays::

  def find_index ( arr : array<auto(TT)> implicit; key : TT )
  def find_index ( arr : auto(TT)[] implicit; key : TT )
  def find_index_if ( arr : array<auto(TT)> implicit; blk : block<(key:TT):bool> )
  def find_index_if ( arr : auto(TT)[] implicit; blk : block<(key:TT):bool> )
