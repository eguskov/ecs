.. |function-builtin-breakpoint| replace:: breakpoint will call os_debugbreakpoint, which is link-time unresolved dependency. It's supposed to call breakpoint in debugger tool, as sample implementation does.

.. |function-builtin-builtin_get_command_line_arguments| replace:: to be documented

.. |function-builtin-capacity| replace:: capacity will return current capacity of table or array `arg`. Capacity is the count of elements, allocating (or pushing) until that size won't cause reallocating dynamic heap.

.. |function-builtin-clear| replace:: clear will clear whole table or array `arg`. The size of `arg` after clear is 0.

.. |function-builtin-memcmp| replace:: to be documented

.. |function-builtin-panic| replace:: will cause panic. The program will be determinated if there is no recover. Panic is not a error handling mechanism and can not be used as such. It is indeed panic, fatal error. It is not supposed that program can completely correctly recover from panic, recover construction is provided so program can try to correcly shut-down or report fatal error. If there is no recover withing script, it will be called in calling eval (in C++ callee code).

.. |function-builtin-emplace| replace:: emplace will push to dynamic array `array_arg` the content of `value`. `value` has to be of the same type (or const reference to same type) as array values. if `at` is provided `value` will be pushed at index `at`, otherwise to the end of array. The `content` of value will be moved (<-) to it.
